# The-Arduino-Integration
The Arduino Integration is a combined project work from Ransford Antwi, Christina Lightfoot, Carter Lepre . In this project, each one of us built a device from the Aduino kit and after building we conjoin them to form an integrated circuit device. We used the Aduino IDE to run all codes.
