# The-Arduino-Integration
The Arduino Integration is a combined project work from Ransford Antwi, Christina Lightfoot, Carter Lepre . In this project, each one of us built a device from the Aduino kit and after building we conjoin them to form an integrated circuit device. We used the Aduino IDE to run all codes. The three projects are
Buzzer
Aduino Memory Game
Ultrasonic Sensor Detector
